## 1. Creating associations in your schema

To do this, we will create a new entity called **clientes** and we will associate it with the entity **livros**

With the created association, we will click on the **clientes** entity, and then on the **Associations** tab. In this tab, click on the **Create Association** button

With that we will see the create association form

Then, we will create an association with the name **livrosDoCliente** 
Então, criaremos uma associação com nome **livrosDoCliente** referencing the entity **book** and can be **nullable**, because a client can have or not a book associated with it.

In case you want to update the name or remove the association, click on the **edit** button. In case you want to cancel the update, click on the **close** button inside the update section
